	Version 0.05

	New test t/02-jiraacceptance.t.

	JiraAcceptance has a new directive: JIRA_LOG_MATCH(Regexp,
	Help). You can specify a regexp to extract the JIRA keys from a
	specific part of the log message. You can also pass a help message
	to be shown to the user if the commit fails.

	The error messages generated by JIRA_ACCEPTANCE are more helpful.

	easier.
