* Email UTF-8
   The SVN::Look module should obtain all information from the svnlook
   command in UTF-8 and use it accordingly. In particular, the emails
   sent by the Mailer plugin should be MIME compatible and specify
   UTF-8 character encoding.

* Use YAML for the configuration files
   I've mixed feelings about the Perl-script-as-a-configuration-file
   thing. It gives us power, but the power is in the hands of the
   repository admins, which can then run scripts in the subversion
   server. A declarative configuration file would be more
   secure. Perhaps we can still preserve all the power we need by
   using YAML [http://www.yaml.org/].

* Reimplement SVN::Look to use the Perl SVN bindings instead of
  calling svnlook. However, another approach would be to implement an
  option in svnlook to dump all information in a format like XML so
  that we wouldn't need to call it several times.

* Check the svnchecker project <http://svnchecker.tigris.org/> to see
  if there is some interesting functionality there that is missing
  here.

* Check the hook ideas in
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/884608/share-common-useful-svn-pre-commit-hooks.

* Implement a plugin for kicking of Jenkins builds.

* Implement a scmbug integration plugin.

* Implement a clone of
