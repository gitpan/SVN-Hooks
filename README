Name:    SVN-Hooks
What:    Framework for Subversion hooks
Version: 0.32
Author:  Gustavo Chaves <gnustavo@cpan.org>

SVN-Hooks is a framework for creating Subversion hooks
(http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.reposadmin.create.html#svn.reposadmin.create.hooks).

It comes with a bunch of plugins (actually, sub-modules of SVN::Hooks)
that implement some of the most used standalone Subversion hooks available
(http://subversion.tigris.org/tools_contrib.html#hook_scripts), such as
pre-commit hooks for enforcing:

- the log message format,
- property settings,
- the repository structure,
- restrictions on the modification of repository areas (e.g., /tags)
- restrictions on filenames, and
- the integration with ticketing systems.

It also comes with post-commit hooks for

- sending commit emails, and
- updating configuration files in the server from changes made
  in the repository.

But as a framework, it can be extended to implement all types of
hooks.

It can also be very fast for two reasons. First because all calls to
the svnlook command are cached, and the information gathered with it
can be reused by all plugins that need it. Second, because it's
possible to have a single script using SVN::Hooks shared by the hooks
of several repositories, and the script can be made persistent with
the use of PersistentPerl (http://daemoninc.com/PersistentPerl/).

Please, read the SVN::Hooks manpage to know how to use it.
