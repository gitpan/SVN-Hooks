SVN::Hooks - A framework for implementing Subversion hooks.

It comes with a bunch of plugins (actually, sub-modules of SVN::Hooks)
that implement some of the most used standalone Subversion hooks
available, such as pre-commit hooks for enforcing:

 * the log message format,
 * property settings,
 * the repository structure,
 * restrictions on the modification of repository areas (e.g., /tags)
 * restrictions on filenames, and
 * the integration with ticketing systems.

It also comes with post-commit hooks for

 * sending commit emails, and
 * updating configuration files in the server from changes made in the repository.

But as a framework, it can be extended to implement all types of hooks.
