=head1 NAME

SVN::Hooks::CheckCapability - Check the svn client capabilities.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.25

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This SVN::Hooks plugin checks if the Subversion client implements the
required capabilities.

It's active in the C<start-commit> hook.

It's configured by the following directive.

=head2 CHECK_CAPABILITY(CAPABILITY...)

This directive enables the checking, causing the commit to abort if it
doesn't comply.

The arguments are a list of capability names. Every capability
specified must be supported by the client in order to the hook to
succeed.

Example:

	CHECK_CAPABILITY('mergeinfo');

=for Pod::Coverage start_commit
